#### Bio:
My main goal at the moment is to **go to university**, but in parallel I want to fully learn how to layout web sites, as well as learn JavaScript. 
I am currently a **Python developer, with 3 years of experience**. I have a good knowledge of hypertext markup language - html. I was also unknowingly interested in creating markdown files in Obsidian application. I lead a healthy lifestyle, have no bad habits, **diligent**, **responsible** **and hardworking**. I would like to warn you that I have a hard time teaching, but **if I take on a task, I will try to see it through to the end.**

#### My projects:
If you need to look at my projects, I can demonstrate them on discord. I can't publish them on Github because I haven't taken care of their security yet.
Also you can get [link](https://seiekshion.github.io/rsschool-cv/) on this CV and share it with your acquaintances.

#### Education level:
I have completed 11 grades and have a general secondary education. In November 2022, I took the course "Code of the Future", the program of which included the creation of graphical interfaces in the Python language.
